Last month I went to the coolest Rammstein show at Schloss Eltz!
After the concert, I ran down the Hauptstrasse chasing a Hund that stole 
my Bratwurst. 
I cornered the hund in a ratskeller, but ripped my lederhose when I tried to grab it.  
I felt surprisingly wettbewerbsfaehig despite the hole in my pants, so I jumped over a BMW to keep chasing the dog.
I caught up with the Hund, and we agreed to get a Doener
at a Biergarten and share some Apfelkuchen.
To cool off after all that running, we ducked into a nearby Baeckerei with a strong Klimaanlage, where the smell of fresh Gebaeck and Brot finally convinced me to forgive the Hund.
