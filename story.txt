Last month I went to the coolest Rammstein show at Schloss Eltz!
After the concert, I ran down the Hauptstrasse chasing a Hund that stole 
my Bratwurst. 
I cornered the hund in a ratskeller, but ripped my lederhose when I tried to grab it.  
I felt surprisingly wettbewerbsfaehig despite the hole in my pants, so I jumped over a BMW to keep chasing the dog.
Then I fell and the Hund got away. After chasing the pooch, I felt I needed some fun so I headed over to a Rammstein concert, ripped lederhosen and all!
