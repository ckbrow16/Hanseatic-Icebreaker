Last month I went to the coolest Rammstein show at Schloss Eltz!
After the concert, I ran down the Hauptstrasse chasing a Hund that stole 
my Bratwurst. 
I cornered the hund in a ratskeller, but ripped my lederhose when I tried to grab it.  
I felt surprisingly wettbewerbsfaehig despite the hole in my pants, so I jumped over a BMW to keep chasing the dog.
The bratwurst was gone after catching the hund so we wound up together eating gebaeck in a Baeckerei in Berlin.
